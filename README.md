# Circle_the_Cat
Puzzle game in which the goal is to trap the cat inside the board. But it's not so easy - the cat is smart and knows at any time what is the shortest path to the board's edges using BFS algorithm.
Strong emphasis on implementing object oriented design principles.
Written in C++ using SFML.
Made as a part of OOP2 course by @ranelbe and me.
