# Circle the Cat
Puzzle game in which the goal is to trap the cat inside the board.
<br>But it's not so easy - the cat is smart and knows at any time what is the shortest path to the board's edges using <b>BFS algorithm</b>.
<br>Strong emphasis on implementing object oriented design principles.
<br>Written in C++ using SFML.
<br>Made as a part of OOP2 course by @ranelbe and me.
